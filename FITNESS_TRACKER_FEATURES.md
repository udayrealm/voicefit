# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker Features

## 🎯 **Complete Fitness Tracking System**

I've built a comprehensive fitness tracking system around your existing Supabase `exercises` table. Here's what's now available:

## 📱 **New Components**

### **1. Exercise Tracker (`/tracker`)**
- **Add exercises** with sets, reps, weight, time, and mood
- **Real-time stats** showing total workouts, streak, volume, average weight
- **Exercise history** with delete functionality
- **Mood tracking** with color-coded indicators
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices

### **2. Workout Analytics (`/analytics`)**
- **Time-based filtering** (Week, Month, All Time)
- **Key metrics** dashboard with visual indicators
- **Mood distribution** charts
- **Exercise frequency** analysis
- **Weekly progress** tracking
- **Monthly trends** visualization

## 🗂️ **Database Structure**

Your existing `exercises` table works perfectly with these features:

```sql
CREATE TABLE exercises (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  user TEXT DEFAULT 'user1',
  exercise TEXT NOT NULL,
  sets INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  reps INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  weight INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  time INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  mood TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
